# Cosmos Data

In this repository are a series of data dumps and screenshots showing the general state of voting power (VP) and VP centralization on a specific date.

These dumps were taken between 1300 and 1500 UTC on 2024-02-20.

## Using this repository

For the merely curious, screenshots and links from the mintscan block explorer are in the `screenshots` folder.

If you want supporting data, dumps at a specific block height between those times, taken for these chains, can be found in `node_dumps`, as well as scripts that will allow you to collect similar data for yourself.
